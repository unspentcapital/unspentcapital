          Back Bitcoin: Get Skin in the Game
        </h1>

          <p className="text-unspent-text-secondary">
            Backing Bitcoin means more than just watching from the sidelines. It means showing support by getting skin in the game. One of the simplest ways to start is by gaining exposure through a regulated Bitcoin ETF or including Bitcoin in your retirement portfolio.
          </p>

          <p className="text-unspent-text-secondary">
            This path is ideal if you're not quite ready for self-custody. It gives you financial exposure to Bitcoin’s performance while you start learning what makes Bitcoin unique—and why so many people choose to save in it directly.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-unspent-accent-secondary mt-8 mb-4">Dollar-Cost Averaging with ETFs</h2>
          <p>
            A popular strategy is <strong>Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)</strong>—investing a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of price. It’s a simple, steady way to build a position over time without trying to time the market.
          </p>

          <p className="text-unspent-text-secondary">
            Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin and are listed on traditional stock exchanges. You can buy them through your regular broker, making them a practical entry point without needing to learn about wallets, keys, or nodes right away.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-unspent-accent-secondary mt-8 mb-4">Where to Start</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
            <li>
              <strong>In New Zealand:</strong> Look for options like the Smartshares Bitcoin ETF (BTC) via platforms like Sharesies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In the US:</strong> Consider spot Bitcoin ETFs such as Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) or BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-unspent-text-secondary">
            These tools let you add Bitcoin to your existing financial plan without changing your entire setup—yet.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-unspent-accent-secondary mt-8 mb-4">Why This Matters</h2>
          <p className="text-unspent-text-secondary">
            Backing Bitcoin in this way helps you:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4 text-unspent-text-secondary">
            <li>Signal your belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential.</li>
            <li>Get comfortable with price volatility and market cycles.</li>
            <li>Build the incentive to learn more about self-custody and the Bitcoin network.</li>
            <li>Use familiar investment tools while gaining real exposure.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mt-8 border-t border-[var(--color-bg-secondary)] pt-6 text-unspent-text-secondary">
  Many people start here—and that’s okay. What matters is taking the first step. Once you’ve backed Bitcoin financially, you’ll find yourself wanting to understand it more deeply. That’s when the real journey begins.
</p>

<p className="text-unspent-text-body mt-6">
  When you're ready to go further, <a href="/journey/stacking-sats" className="text-unspent-accent-primary underline">start using it</a>. Choose a Lightning wallet—custodial or not, it doesn’t matter at this stage—and grab a Lightning Address (it’s like an email address for money). Start earning and spending sats, and explore the Bitcoin economy firsthand.
